# Tongyi - General Translation Enginne

## In brief: how Tongyi works

Tongyi uses dictionary to guess the meaning of each element in a string, and try to reorganize these meanings according to the potential (syntax) structure among them, taking into account the nature of the source language. Then Tongyi uses dictionary again to convert (linerize) the whole structure into ordered strings, taking into account the nature of the target language.

The internal data structure of Tongyi, the format of dictionary files will be documented in the future.
